For Linux Based Systems , you may have to activate an virtual environment on your Systems.

To activate a virtual environment created with venv or virtualenv on a Linux system, you use the source command.

The general command is:

Bash

source <virtual_environment_directory>/bin/activate
For example, if you created a virtual environment named myenv in your current directory, you would activate it like this:

Bash

source myenv/bin/activate
## Complete Workflow
Here is the typical workflow for creating and using a Python virtual environment on Linux. üêç

Create the Environment
First, navigate to your project directory and create the virtual environment. It's standard practice to use the built-in venv module. This command creates a new directory (e.g., myenv) containing the Python interpreter and supporting files.

Bash

python3 -m venv myenv
Activate the Environment
Next, activate it using the source command.

Bash

source myenv/bin/activate
You'll know it's active because your shell prompt will be prefixed with the name of the environment, like (myenv).

Deactivate the Environment
When you are finished working, you can exit the environment by simply typing:

Bash

deactivate
